The `datasets/` folder is a template. Populate it when you clone the repo.

Usage:
    For each nn created, there should be a dataset with same name,
    with two subfolders `images/` and `labels/`

Example:
    nn/
    └── 3objs/
    ...
    
    datasets/
    └── 3objs/
        └── images/
        └── labels/
    ...
